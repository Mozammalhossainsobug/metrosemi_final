* Wafer Bow is defined as the deviation of the center point of the front
surface of ares. unclamped wafer supparted by 3 pons equally spaced
on a circle within the diameter a specified amount less than the nominal
diameter of the wafer

* Actual Repeatability or Accuracy of file stress depends on the type of
film, thickness of the file and substrate
